/**
 * 
 * This class defines a goal recognition heuristic called Goal Completion Heuristic - hgc(G).
 * <p>
 * The hgc(G) estimates the percentage of completion of a goal based on the number of landmarks that have been detected, 
 * and are required to achieve that goal. More specifically, this estimate represents the percentage of sub-goals in a goal 
 * that have been accomplished based on the evidence of achieved fact landmarks in the observations. 
 * A candidate goal is composed of sub-goals comprised of the atomic facts that are part of a conjunction of facts.
